# shape-app
This web application was created as the final project for the Web Apps course at Hanover College, taught by Dr. Skiadas.
The application itself was supposed to have a canvas and provide the ability for users to add shapes, lines, and text. 
they could then manipulate those shapes into different arangements. Full specifications are listed below.

**Note:** this application will not be developed further.

# Expectations of the assignment
- There is a main canvas with configurable dimensions.
- The user can pick from a list of "shapes" to add. This should include lines, rectangles, ovals, and text.
- Once a shape is created or selected on the canvas, the interface below should offer customization settings (e.g. line type, color, etc).
- There should be a predefined list of colors.
- Color/fill/line settings for to-be-created shapes should be rememberd from the last shape of that type to be created/edited.
- A "new" button would allow the shape to be added to the canvas with some initial settings.
- Elements can be dragged aroudn to be repositioned or their coordinates can be directly typed.
- Dragging starting from a corner should allow resizing (or repositiong of that corner if it is a line). 
- Dragging starting from a side should allow resizing only in that dimension.
- Lines should have the option to turn either end to an arrow.
- A list of the created elements is created on the right side.
- Users can select an existing element by selecting it on that list, or by clicking on it in the canvas.
